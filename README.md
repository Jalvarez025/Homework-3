# Homework-3

## My Task
From the provided code I gathered that my task was to introduce logic that would make the website function as a random password generator. I must construct a code using javascript and Html to ask for prompts such as wheather or not the user wanted a password containing any upper case letters, special characters, or numbers. The provided code contained an event listener that would start the program.

## Logic
I wrote two functions that would first begin the code on a clickI and it began by applying prompts to gather string variables from the user. After gathering data, then a password is generated using if, else if, else. The logic would also alert the user when they entered something outside the parameters given. For instance the password must contain between 8 and 128 characters. Also they must enter 'y/Y' for yes and 'n/N' for no.
